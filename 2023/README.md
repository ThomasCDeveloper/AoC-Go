# Advent of Code 2023 post-mortem

Pretty happy about how it turned out.
Except for day 12 part 2, for which I had to learn what memoization is with some help, I managed to do everything until day 21 or so.

After that, I had to look up on the Internet tips or more.

I am quite unhappy about how I solved day 24 : I used an online solver to solve the equations system, maybe I'll go back to this exercice later.

I cannot find a way to make my day 23-p2 work (even after "converting" some python code I found on Hyperneutrino repo to Go)
